# Advent of Code 2024

My entries for AOC 2024. Generally, you can run everything from the root of the directory. You will need to supply your own input files (named 'input1.txt', etc). 

Almost everything just uses the standard library. However, day 14 requires PILLOW to make some images - I didn't figure that one out in an automated fashion, and I just generated 1000 png files for manual review. It was less painful than it sounds.

Day 24... ugh. Immature rant - this problem sounds trivial for anyone who majored in CS or plays too much Minecraft and was a huge pain in the butt for anyone else. I used networkX to make a cool visual that came CLOSE to solving it... but then I buckled and just referenced a solution from reddit. 

Overall - fun year! One theme that stood out was studying your input data before banging out a solution. As someone who proclaims to work with data, I should really spend more time doing this! This was particularly true on day 17. I was really chuffed that I solved this one without looking up a solution! The only hint I grabbed from Bluesky was "study your input data." By working through a few examples by hand, you should see that the possibity space for a solution is significantly smaller than it initially seems. Other problems this year also had this property. I would probably have had an easier time in past years if I studied the data there as well!

I was pretty busy this AOC season - my third girl just turned 3 months old! Between her, work obligations, and visiting family, I was really strapped for time. These factors are all the more reason why this year was a big confidence booster for me in terms of my fluency as a software developer. I recognize that this year was probably an easier year, but there were really only a few problems that both parts took me more than 30 minutes to knock out. 

Anyways, maybe you can learn something for my solutions. They are poorly documented - sorry-not-sorry.
